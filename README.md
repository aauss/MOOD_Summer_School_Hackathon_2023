# MOOD Summer School Hackathon 2023

This is Sebastian and my contribution to the MOOD Summer School 2023 Hackathon.

We picked challenge A, which was about predicting the occurrence of ticks in the UK between 2014-2021. We used a dataset by [Alan Radford](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/infection-veterinary-and-ecological-sciences/staff/alan-radford/) from the University of Liverpool that uses text mining to find electronic health records of companion animals mentioning tick occurrence/removal.

We tried to predict the number of tick cases using various environmental covariats projected to a 1x1 km grid of UK using ensemble machine learning.

You can find details in the R-Markdown file. The data is not available yet, but may be after the authors around this MOOD project will publish their findings.
